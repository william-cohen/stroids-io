# eslint-plugin-output-todo-comments [![npm version](https://badge.fury.io/js/eslint-plugin-output-todo-comments.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/js/eslint-plugin-output-todo-comments)
Contains single rule that warns about used warning comments and shows them as they are.

This plugin contains stupidly copy-pasted **no-warning-comments** rule with one little modification: it shows warn comment as it is instead of showing meaningless warning "Unexpected 'todo' comment". [Check out original documentation for no-warning-comments](http://eslint.org/docs/rules/no-warning-comments).

```js
// TODO: We may need to make this thing better
// TODO: Function fooBar need to return something good
// TODO: Wow!
```

The plugin doesn't include any tests and it's created as quick and dirty solution for my internal needs.

## Install
```
npm install -D eslint-plugin-output-todo-comments
```

```js
module.exports = {
    "plugins": ["output-todo-comments"],

        ],
